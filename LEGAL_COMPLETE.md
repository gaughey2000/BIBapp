## 🆘 Common Questions

### Q: Can I launch without insurance?
**A:** ❌ NO - You cannot legally treat clients without professional indemnity insurance in the UK.

### Q: Do I need ICO registration?
**A:** ⚠️ PROBABLY YES - If you're storing customer data (names, emails, phone numbers), you likely need to register. It's £40/year and takes 5 minutes online.

### Q: Can I use the site for bookings before adding all legal stuff?
**A:** ✅ YES for testing with friends - ❌ NO for public bookings until insurance is confirmed.

### Q: What if a customer doesn't accept cookies?
**A:** ✅ GOOD! The site works fine with only essential cookies. They can still book appointments.

### Q: Can I change the legal pages?
**A:** ⚠️ CAREFULLY - The structure is legally sound. You can customize details but don't remove important sections. Consider legal review if making major changes.
